# ESMF Aspect Meta Model Java

The `esmf-aspect-meta-model-java` module provides the Java implementation for the Semantic Aspect
Meta Model (SAMM). Each model element and each Characteristic class is represented by an
interface with a corresponding implementation.

`Units` Enumeration is generated by the `unit2java.groovy` script which is executed during the build
of this module.
